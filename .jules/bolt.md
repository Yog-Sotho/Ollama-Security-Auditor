## 2026-07-28 - [Target Audit Concurrency]
**Learning:** Sequential async executions of independent probes (such as WAF detection, weight exfil, streaming DoS, modelfile RCE, metadata SSRF, token brute-forcing, and prompt injection leakage) degrade audit times linearly. Batching them with `asyncio.gather` reduces the overall latency from several seconds to the duration of the longest request.
**Action:** Replace the sequential await/append patterns with `asyncio.gather` for independent probe endpoints in `OllamaSecurityAuditor.run_audit`.
